Number Pad Conversion Calculator

Completed as a project assignment for a mobile app development class, but none of the code was starter code provided by the professor as other projects in that course tend to be.

A fairly simple calculator that contains buttons in a grid that alter a label above and that label text is converted from the select input type to three other numeric representations. For example, you can set the input mode to decimal, and it will show conversions below the number pad for hexadecimal, binary, octal, and decimal (but decimal to decimal is not exactly a conversion).
